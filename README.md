Service is implemented using Flask framework and MongoDB which hosted on Atlas.

The service is available at the following url:

Possible Pitfalls/Optimizations:
1. Async - In my implementation the operation of writing to the db (collection.insert_many(buffer)) is taken place synchronously.
   In a real-life production-ready environment, using asynchronous writes can significantly enhance performance by leveraging the database's multiprocessing capabilities.
2. Buffer Size - In the task i've used an arbitrary buffer size (100k).
   Increasing the buffer size to match the available RAM on the machine can improve performance by reducing the number of interactions with MongoDB, thereby minimizing time lost to latency issues.
4. Error Handling - It is better to catch more specific errors other than catching 'Exception'.
5. Indexing - My decision to use composite index on longtitude and latitude suits the task's required queries.
   In case we will want to support more queries, a different index might be considered.
